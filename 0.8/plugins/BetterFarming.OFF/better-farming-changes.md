Version: 1.21.4

Author: robb@canfield.com

- Backed up the original settings from default better Farms (1.21.4) as *.orig.yml
- Copied old 1.20 configurations
  - Those configurations are balanced to be less overpowered in my opinion. And also allow for some
  more powerful / long-lasting fuels. I expect these to need more balance.
- BetterFarming for 1.21 seemed to have added built in XP costs vs. just the last Levels that wre in 1.20. So Changed
the costs from Vault to internal XP. This negates the need for a separate Vault/Commerce module.
- Used IntelliJ compare to merge settings and merged the old with new settings. There were only
a few changes. Mostly comments and some updates to some farm data, mostly trees.
