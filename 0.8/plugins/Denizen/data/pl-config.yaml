light-chunk:
  torch:
      # How many XP for every torch placed: 10 was a bit high, as it ogten to 8 torches to fill a chunk
      # which is almost level 6. Even t level 25 only afew chunks could be filled

  feeder:
    # Feeder location data (trigger) is proccessed every x ticks where the x is calculated
    # by a simple hash that when moded by tick_delay being zero the feeder is processed.
    #   Use 0 to fire every tick, useful for debugging
    #   10 for one stack per feeder per 0.5 seconds (the others seem WAY to fast for our game)
    #    5 for one stack per feeder per 0.25 seconds
    #   NOTE: If players game this by just doubling the feeders, we may need to deal wth that somehow.
    #   But if reasonable complaints arrive we can just set tick delay per to 5

    #   Use a minium of .5 to prevent a feeder placing items into self if also an inventory (no longer necessary)
    #   Use a 1 to prevent macthing NSEWUP of container

    # so a chest on one end of a base can reach the other without goign across the world.
    #   Radisu of 5 chunks menas a base that can be 11 chunks by 11 chunks. Each chunk is 16 so 176
    #   blocks. And that is a radius. So feeders operate in a  radius 10 meaning 11x11 (which is the entire chunk vertically. I might need to fix that)
