light-chunk:
  torch:

    # Feeder location data (trigger) is proccessed every x ticks where the x is calculated
    # by a simple hash that when moded by tick_delay being zero the feeder is processed.
    #   Use 0 to fire every tick, useful for debugging
    #   10 for one stack per feeder per 0.5 seconds (the others seem WAY to fast for our game)
    #    5 for one stack per feeder per 0.25 seconds
    #   NOTE: If players game this by just doubling the feeders, we may need to deal wth that somehow.
    #   But if reasonable complaints arrive we can just set tick delay per to 5
